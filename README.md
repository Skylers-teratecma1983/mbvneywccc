Okay, so first of all, why does Snow White always have to be the fairest one of all? Like seriously, every mirror seems to have it out for the Queen, poor thing. And don't even get me started on her encounter with the dwarfs. They're kinda cute but also, like, what's with the singing? I'd have lost my mind, totally. Although, can you imagine showing up to work with seven tiny men just chilling in the room, doing their thing? I'd need a serious facial after that level of stress.

> And dude, that Prince! Just rolls up on a white horse, wakes her up with a kiss—no consent at all, by the way—and everyone's just okay with this? I mean, what is this teaching kids? That if you're pretty enough, some prince will magically show up? Like, come on, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again. It’s full of these old-school ideals, and I can't even with that.

But hey, the Evil Queen’s glam? Now THAT I can get behind! Those eyebrows were on point. I'd die to know her skin regimen, minus the poison apple bit, of course. Speaking of apples, can't believe they were so pivotal to the plot—what's next, killer oranges? 

Anyway, honestly, after all the drama, you'd expect Snow to at least like, hit up a spa day or something. She needs collagen masks stat, throwing shade like that won't help her complexion.

std::cout << Why is this even here lol; 

You know, I'm just babbling at this point. Sorry, I'm just so tired, it's like a face mask and bed kind of night! Zahara said we should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe I'll get more ideas... but maybe with a glass of wine in hand. Let's see how that goes haha. Anyway, how are you doing? Need any skincare advice? 🍏✨
